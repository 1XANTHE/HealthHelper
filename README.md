# HealthHelper

Welcome to my project! This project is designed to provide personalized weather-related recommendations and task management functionalities based on user health parameters. By integrating user health data with real-time weather information, the application offers tailored recommendations to users, promoting health-conscious decision-making and productivity.

## Features

### 1. User Registration and Login
- Allows users to register for an account and securely log in.
- Utilizes Servlets, JDBC, and JSP for user authentication and session management.

### 2. Health Parameter Input Form
- Provides a form for users to input their health parameters, including age, weight, height, gender, BMI, blood pressure, and heart rate.
- Example: A JSP page with input fields for each health parameter, with validation checks using JavaScript or server-side validation with Servlets.

### 3. Weather Data Integration
- Fetches real-time weather data from an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and displays it on a UI.
- The parameters fetched are temperature, date/day, weather condition (e.g., clear sky, rain, thunderstorm, etc.), and humidity.

### 4. Recommendation System Enhancement
- Enhances the recommendation system to consider user health parameters alongside weather conditions.
- Classifies user health status based on predefined thresholds for age, BMI, blood pressure, etc.
- Generates personalized recommendations based on the combined analysis of health parameters and weather conditions.
- Example: An algorithm that analyzes user health data and weather forecasts to recommend suitable activities, such as staying indoors during extreme weather for elderly users.

## Installation and Setup
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Deploy the application to a Java web server like Apache Tomcat.
